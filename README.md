# Heliotrope API Wrapper

A TypeScript-based API wrapper for the [Heliotrope API](https://heliotrope.saebasol.org/docs), designed for both Node.js and browser environments. It uses the native Fetch API, minimizing external dependencies.

## Features

- ✅ **TypeScript First**: Strongly typed for better developer experience.
- 🚀 **Lightweight**: Uses `fetch` API, no heavy dependencies like Axios.
- 📦 **Dual Environment Support**: Works seamlessly in Node.js and modern browsers.
- 🏗️ **Modern Build**: Bundled with [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) for CJS and ESM outputs.
- 📚 **Class-based Models**: API responses are parsed into model class instances for easier handling.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @saebasol/delphinium
# or
yarn add @saebasol/delphinium
# or
